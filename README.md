# Brain-Tumor-Detection
The idea of the project was to reproduce and improve the result of a [scientific publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8934561) on Brain tumor detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with MRI images.

# Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
The CNN will extract features maps from each image through an operation called convolution which works by taking a cluster of pixels and multiplying each pixel with the
convolutional filter corresponding (the one that the neural network learn) and making a sum of the multiplyed pixels, repeating this process for all the pixels in a
given image, the result will be a feature map. The feature map will be aplied to another test image and used like a feature identifier, a convolution operation will be 
made and for avery cluster of the test image the filter will be aplied, if the test image has the given caracteristics the result will be a high number ,making possible 
to identify, in this case, what is or what is not a brain tumor.

# Max Pooling
The maximum pooling layer is a compression layer, reducing the computation of all the convolution steps. The max pooling works by taking a cluster of a given size and 
shifting around the image and for each movement either taking the avarage of the values or choosing the max value of the cluster.

# MRI images
The database contains 4600 different images, with various sizes and shapes taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), with MRI images classified as healthy or unhealthy.
## Healthy
